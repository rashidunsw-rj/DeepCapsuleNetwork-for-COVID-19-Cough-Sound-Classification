### Materials and Methods

#### Datasets
The study utilized two publicly available cough datasets:
- **COSWARA Dataset** (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2005.10548)
- **COUGHVID Dataset** (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2006.04342)

Each cough recording was preprocessed using Librosa, followed by data augmentation through pitch shifting, additive noise, and time stretching. Feature extraction included MFCCs, chroma, mel-spectrogram, tonnetz, and spectral contrast features. The dataset was balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

#### Model Description
The proposed **DeepCapsNet** integrates 1D convolutional layers for local feature learning and capsule layers for hierarchical representation. The network includes dropout regularization and uses the Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.0001).  
The model was trained using **Stratified K-Fold cross-validation**, and each trained model (.h5) corresponding to a fold is provided.

#### Evaluation Method
Evaluation was performed on both COSWARA and COUGHVID datasets to compare the proposed **DeepCapsNet** with baseline CNN models. Metrics include:
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- RMSE per class  
- G-Mean  
- 95% Confidence Intervals  

All experiments were implemented using Python (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and NumPy).
